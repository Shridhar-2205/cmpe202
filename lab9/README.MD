In regular implementation of Strategy Design pattern, we have to create <b>different strategy classes</b> like in this scenario we have to create strategy classes like fixed deposit, savings, and current account.

Using lambda style we can avoid additional classes for concrete strategies, avoiding <b>redundancy</b>. We donâ€™t need <b>additional classes</b> we can simply give strategy using lambda expression, thus <b>reduced line of code and simplicity</b>.
